### Project Description
The Disease Prediction Platform is an advanced health diagnostic tool designed to assist individuals in understanding and managing their health through quick and reliable symptom analysis. By inputting key symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing, users receive predictions about potential health conditions, enabling them to take informed actions.

### The Problem statement
In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, individuals often face challenges in quickly understanding and assessing their health conditions. With a wide range of symptoms that could point to various diseases, it can be overwhelming and time-consuming for users to determine the severity of their symptoms and seek appropriate medical guidance. The lack of immediate symptom analysis tools can lead to delayed healthcare decisions, contributing to rising health concerns.

### The Solution
The Disease Prediction Platform addresses this critical need by providing a quick, reliable, and accessible tool for users to analyze their symptoms and gain insights into potential health conditions. By inputting common symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing, users receive predictions about possible diseases, enabling them to make timely decisions about their health.
